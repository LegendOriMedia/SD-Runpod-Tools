# SD-Runpod-Tools
Howdy - I would not call myself a coder or a programmer.  But I did create some tools out of necessity, so I thought I'd share them, as the amazing Stable Diffusion and Gitbub communities have shared so much with me!  My life would not be the same without you, so I hope this adds a smidgeon of value to your life.

These are the first tools I've created, and I don't know the proper formatting or file structures or anything for uploading to Github - so hope they are easily accessible.

So far I've created two tools.  

The first is a tool to Change the Icon that shows up in your browser tab in Stable Diffusion when using Runpod. 

I use multiple pods at a time, and I go bonkers trying to keep straight which Jupyter and which Stable Diffusion windows go with which pod, and I've nearly lost many important files because of this confusion. 

So this makes it easy.  Just run the ipynb file, Choose a number that you'd like to use for this particular pod, and then restart your pod, and Hard-refresh (ctrl F5) your tab, and... Voila!  You now have a very easy to read, bold, colorful icon with that number.

I've made 10. If you need more than that, tell me, I'll make more... and I'll also think you're an absolute badass, 'cause that means you're doing amazing things, needing that many GPUs!
